This project is a data analysis and visualization platform for GitHub language statistics, composed of two main parts: a series of Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and a React-based interactive dashboard.

### Project Overview

*   **Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`):** These are used for data exploration, analysis, and generating visualizations. The workflow starts with `00_master_index.ipynb` and proceeds sequentially. The primary dataset is `repositories_enriched.csv`.
*   **React Frontend (`src/**/*.tsx`):** A web application that provides an interactive dashboard to visualize the data from the notebooks. The main component is `Dashboard.tsx`, which orchestrates the different views.

### Key Files

*   `README.md`: Provides a detailed guide to the Jupyter Notebook analysis workflow.
*   `00_master_index.ipynb`: The starting point for understanding the data analysis part.
*   `App.tsx`: The main entry point for the React application, handling routing.
*   `Dashboard.tsx`: The main dashboard component that renders different analysis sections.
*   `analysisData.ts` & `languages.ts`: These files contain data and configurations for the frontend visualizations.
*   `*.csv`: Data files used and generated by the notebooks.

### Developer Workflow

#### Jupyter Notebooks

1.  **Setup:** Install the required Python packages listed in the `README.md` (e.g., `pandas`, `plotly`, `seaborn`).
2.  **Execution:** Run the notebooks in numerical order, starting with `00_master_index.ipynb`, as they have dependencies on each other.

#### React Frontend

1.  **Setup:** This is a standard TypeScript-based React project. Install dependencies using a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`.
2.  **Running:** Use the standard scripts to start the development server (e.g., `npm start`).
3.  **Component Structure:** Components are organized by feature under the `src/components` directory. New UI features should follow this pattern.

### Data Flow

1.  The Jupyter notebooks process the initial datasets (like `repositories_enriched.csv`) and produce derived data files (e.g., `language_comparison_summary.csv`, `top_growth_repos.csv`).
2.  The React application imports data from these generated `.csv` and `.ts` files to populate the interactive visualizations in the dashboard. When adding new visualizations, ensure the data is loaded efficiently, either from existing data files or by creating new ones from the notebooks.
